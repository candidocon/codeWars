//given n (where n >= 1) find n consecutive odd numbers whose sum is exactly the cube of n.
function findSummands(n) {
  //replace with your solution ...
  return [1];
}

console.log(findSummands(3)); // should [7,9,11]
// because 7 + 9 + 11 = 27, the cube of 3. Note that there are only n = 3 elements in the array.

// write your own tests here ...
